# help-wanted board

This project is intended to provide Techlahoma Usergroup Leaders and committee chairs a place to search for help. The board may be used in this manner:

  - A usergroup leader or committee chair has a task they need completed
  - The person opens an issue at https://github.com/techlahoma/help-wanted/issues

  - Issue information should include:
    - Usergroup or committee name
    - Contact person
    - Slack/Twitter handle for contact person
    - Brief description of issue
    - Brief description of what is needed

  - Issue should be tagged with the appropriate usergroup or committee label
  - That's it!

Techlahoma will advertise the board to volunteers as a way to help Techlahoma and their favorite usergroups.

Let one of the project owners know if you have any questions!
