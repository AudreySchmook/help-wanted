# help-wanted board

This project is intended to provide Techlahoma Usergroup Leaders and committee chairs a place to search for help. The board may be used in this manner:

## I need help

  1. A usergroup leader or committee chair has a task they need completed
  2. The person opens an issue at https://github.com/techlahoma/help-wanted/issues

  - Issue information should include:
    - Usergroup or committee name
    - Contact person
    - Slack/Twitter handle for contact person
    - Brief description of issue
    - Brief description of what is needed

  - Issue should be tagged with the appropriate usergroup or committee label
  - That's it!

Techlahoma will advertise the board to volunteers as a way to help Techlahoma and their favorite usergroups.

## I want to help

  1. Browse through open issues
  2. Contact the contact person for the issue you want to help with
  3. Assign yourself to the issue and complete it
  4. That's it! Thanks for your help!
